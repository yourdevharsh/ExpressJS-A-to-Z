# ExpressJS A-to-Z üöÇ

This repository documents my personal journey of learning Express.js, the fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. The projects are structured alphabetically, starting from the very basics ("Hello World") and progressively moving towards more complex API concepts.

Each folder is a self-contained, runnable Express application that demonstrates a specific feature or concept.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Each Project

Each project is a standalone application. To run one:

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    # Example for the Calculator API
    cd "B. Calculator API"
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Each folder should have its own `package.json` file.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    # or node app.js, check the main file in the directory
    ```
    The server will start, and you can access the API, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üéØ Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a hands-on learning log. By building these small, focused APIs, I aim to gain a solid understanding of the core concepts of Express.js and backend development in general.
